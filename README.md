## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🖼️ OpenCV
- 🔢 NumPy
- 📊 Pandas

Install dependencies using:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
```

---

### ▶️ Usage

1. **Register Students:**  
   Run `main.py` and use the interface to register new students. Images will be saved in `TrainingImage/`.

2. **Train Model:**  
   Train the model after registration. The trained model is saved in `TrainingImageLabel/Trainner.yml`.

3. **Mark Attendance:**  
   Use the attendance feature to recognize faces and mark attendance in the `Attendance/` folder.

4. **View Attendance:**  
   Open the relevant CSV file in the `Attendance/` folder to view attendance records.

## 📊 Attendance File Format

Attendance files (e.g., `Attendance_14-06-2025.csv`) have the following columns:

| 🆔 Id | 👤 Name | 📅 Date | ⏰ Time |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
